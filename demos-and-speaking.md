I do demos and workshops for work. They usually go well, sometimes they haven't. Here's what I think contributes to things working better.

# Tips for better demos

1. Match the content to participant's needs. Do this in discussing the session, when scheduling it, and when starting the session. The participants' needs always is more important than what you prepare.
1. Practice is more important than preparation. Poor content, well practiced, is better than great content, or an amazing demo, that you don't solidly have a handle on. 
1. Never rush the start. The first 15 seconds, the first 2 minutes, are critical for establishing the participant's confidence. Find out who they are, why they're here. See point 1.
1. Address problems in real time. Not "this is broken". But, "Now I've got some great content here, yet I've not shared it up to GitHub yet. Let's take a moment to share that."
1. Talk about what you're doing. If you're needing to fix something, talk about fixing it. Don't try to talk about something else while you fix one thing (it won't work). 
1. If something's taking a long time, explain why. Be okay with it, and they will be too. Don't try to start a new thread; it'll just confuse folks.
1. Hofstader's law is doubly true for setting up videoconferencing. Allow at least 10 minutes, and if things take longer, don't let that rush you
1. Always answer questions from first principles. Be interested in what you're saying, and they will be too.
1. Breathe.

# Tips for better content

1. Start with ideas, then words, then pictures (or demos), then slides. 
  - Never let an image drive the idea. An image can inspire an idea, which you then express in words. If that idea no longer fits the image, then jettison the image. If the idea no longer stands, it wasn't a good idea..
  - I have tried to make slides around an image that I liked. It never ended well.
