# How I work

## Work

### Starting the Day

Ideally, I have 2 hours free at the start of the day to **Just Work**, then I orient myself to the rest of the day:

- Calendar in Leuchtturm
  - Update from Google Cal
- Check Toggl for status/corrections
- Jot into Leuchtturm:
  - Mantras & Habits
  - 18F block
  - Professional block
  - Me & Family block
  - Jot code:
    - ` _1_ ` ToDo, with priority
    - `[_1_]` In progress
    - `[_X_]` Done
    
    
### Habits

External habits:
- Use Toggl to _know what I'm doing_
- Use Pomodoro so I will periodically review what I'm doing
- Use Alfred timers for tasks that could turn into yak-shaves
 ... more to come
 
Internal habits:
- breathe
- listen (music, murmur)
- relax and/or move
- mantra
 
### Ending the day

I'm bad at this. I often just push to InboxZeor and SlackZero and walk away.
    
### Possible changes
- Tee up one deep work item the previous day to work on first
- Work with SLH to get alternate morning head start days
- Track time again with RescueTime
- Schedule time for email catch up.
- How to use my _Mantras &amp; Habits_ block?
